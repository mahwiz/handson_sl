# Multilayer Precepton
- A multilayer percepton is a feedforward neural network 
--The information moves in only one direction forward from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes(if any) and to the output nodes.
--There are no cycle or loops in the network 
- It contains an input layer, one or more hidden layer and an output layer 
- A MLP with one hidden layer is also called a simple or vanilla ANN
- If there are more than two hidden layers it is Deep Neural Network (DNN)
- Training Neural Network with more than one hidden layer is Deep Learning
